</div>
<div class="vis pos-13 size-10 cont-12">
<div class="vis-3 pos-5 size-11 cont-13">
<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">The 17-year-old upcoming rapper from the Bronx mixes a melodic flow with hard hitting lyrics depicting life on the streets to beautifully craft this song. The beat doesn&rsquo;t seemingly match the lyrics, as its optimistic sound doesn&rsquo;t fit in with lyrics like &ldquo;bodies drop all the time I don&rsquo;t feel nothing&rdquo;. However, this contrast serves to add an extra meaning to the song showing how there is still hope despite the negativity going on in the song. This fits especially well with Lil Tjay&rsquo;s life, who has left the traditional gang life following a year in jail to pursue a career in music. Overall, this is an amazing song that can be both chill or hype depending on your mood.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">Speaking in 2</span><span class="font-8"><sup class="font-7">nd</span><span class="font-6"> person to himself, Polo G raps over a chill beat describing his life on the streets, the struggles that come with it and how he came to be in it. The song deals with the consequences of living the traditional street life, saying things like &ldquo;a lot of people dying and it&rsquo;s a chance that you might&rdquo; and &ldquo;my friends died too, I know that feeling&rdquo;. However, the song goes further, showing how most people who grow gang affiliated didn&rsquo;t choose the life but were sucked into it. One of the deepest lines of the song says there weren&rsquo;t any &ldquo;heroes, so we looked up to the villains.&rdquo; Paired with a chill beat and a sort of laid back but melodic flow, this song is excellent to listen to while chilling and reflect on the sad reality presented in the song.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<div class="vis pos-11 size-18 cont-12">
<div class="vis-3 pos-5 size-19 cont-13">
<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">Most Uzi fans thought there would be no more music from the &ldquo;Money Longer&rdquo; star following his announcement that he was done with music back in January of 2019, so everyone was pleasantly surprised when he released this song. And they were definitely not disappointed. The song has the traditional Uzi lyrics, speaking about money and girls, but like most of his other songs the flow, beat and sound make it an absolute must listen. Uzi&rsquo;s skill to ride beats and create an absolutely stunning sound is unparalleled in the game right now, and this song could be one of his best yet. If you want to get hype, this song is perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="vis-3 pos-5 size-23 cont-13">
<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">In Crossroads, Lil Durk leaves the traditional rap environment that deals with violence and flexing how many people you killed to talk about putting an end to violence. Saying by name a few of the people Durk himself has lost to the streets, including his cousin Nuski and his friends Fredo and LA, this song has a powerful effect on the listener. Too often rap songs condone violence and this song speaks down on that. It is a very chill song with a nice flow and excellent lyrics coming together for a beautiful message.</span></p>

<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">Yung Pinch speaks down on love, putting it in a terribly negative light, leaving all listeners unwilling to even try love. He describes how love has destroyed his life, saying &ldquo;love is a sickness&rdquo; and &ldquo;she tear my heart out and I let her&rdquo;.&nbsp; Coupled with the slow, sad beat this song is perfect for anyone having love problems. However, you don&rsquo;t have to be heartbroken to enjoy the song; anyone feeling down can fall into the slow, sad beat coupled with Pinch&rsquo;s soothing voice and feel his suffering. All in all, this is an amazing song but take caution before you play it because it may cause tears.&nbsp;</span></p>

Coupled with a chill beat with well placed drums, Swae sings about a girl, saying &ldquo;we can get away, maybe to Guatemala&rdquo;. Slim Jxmmi verse then comes in and absolutely completes the song. Departing from his usual style, Jxmmi experiments with a more vocal approach and it sounds amazing. Everything in this song comes together to put the listener in a different mind state, where they feel perfectly relaxed and everything seems positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">Pray 4 Love by Travis Scott, featuring The Weeknd, tells a gripping story of the struggles Travis Scott goes through despite his rising fame and fortune. The numerous religious undertones speak of the &ldquo;demons&rdquo; of fame such as drugs and an over-attachment to materialistic values. The dark and powerful melodies hummed out by The Weeknd and Travis Scott power the chorus of the song. The individual verses are presented with an old school rapping technique used to tell stories. Travis Scott also explores racism and white supremacy throughout the song. The production of the entire song is unparalleled, and it climaxes into a stunning Weeknd solo which brings the entire masterpiece to a close.</span></p>

<div class="vis pos-11 size-29 cont-12">
<div class="vis-3 pos-5 size-30 cont-13">
<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">Kanye&rsquo;s debut album College Dropout is said to be one of the best Kanye creations ever. Through the Wire tells the tale of Kanye&rsquo;s fight through a recovery after a serious automobile accident. The song title reflects how Kanye had his jaw wired shut for weeks following the accident. In fact, the original version of the song was rapped by Kanye when his jaw was still wired shut. Kanye&rsquo;s lyricism is unparalleled and his subtle mentions about the protein shakes such as Boost and Ensure tie back to the fact that he could not eat solid foods due to his accident. Like the rest of his discography, the production is top notch. Kanye is known to re-release albums multiple times to make sure they are perfect and exactly what he wants them to be.</span></p>

<div class="vis-3 pos-19 size-30 cont-15">
<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">XXXTentacion&rsquo;s untimely death was arguably one of the most tragic events in the last decade, but his legacy continues to live through his music. This song has always stood out as one of his best songs and will probably go down as one of my favorite songs of all time.&nbsp; Taking a break from his usual style of screaming over base heavy beats, X sings to a past lover and makes one of the saddest songs of all time. Hearing the song always put you in a mood, but the song hits even harder when listeners remember that the one who crafted the song has now passed away. The slow violin filled beat only adds to the effect, and leaves the listener wanted to crawl into their bed and forget the terrible events that took place to XXXTentacion.</span></p>

<div class="vis-3 pos-19 size-36 cont-18">
<p class="para-2"><span class="font-6">XXXtentacion amazes his fans once again with a slow, emotional piece. Ditching his love for bass boosted screaming matches, X creates a short masterpiece dedicated for those who died in the Parkand, Florida shootings. He mentions in the song that those who were victims of the tragedy should no lose hope in the world. X states that he is tired of all the hate going around and wants to envision the world as a better place. The song is short, however, is meant to be played on repeat as the transition between replays is flawless. The smooth synths in the background match perfectly with the drums that carries the beat forward &mdash; never losing its momentum. This song hits hardest for his most dedicated fans. His urges to view the world as a better place only make his death seem more traumatic as he was murdered in his car by a rival crew. R.I.P X.</span></p>
